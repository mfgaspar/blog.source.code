It would be nice to have Pentaho as the engine for Analytics for the Personal Assistants as Google Now, Google Assistant, Alexa Facebook Messenger or even Slack among others.  So, as a Proof-of-concept, I've build a personal assistant using Pentaho and DialogFlow (from google). 

#Hi, how can I help?

When using the personal assistant, you will say "Hi Google" or "Alexa" and the your will get a response back as "HI, how can I help?". Definitely it would be very useful if we could run analytics through our favourite personal assistant.  

I have produced a short video with a short demo on how we can perform analytics even without touching the keyboard or mouse. See the video **[here](https://youtu.be/csLaInmw9QQ)**

#How hard can it be to run analytics on Pentaho?

Imagine final users on their energy provider app at their smart homes and using Google Now or Alexa to get to know how much energy they are consuming, or how much more are they saving on cost or how "green" they are
Imagine also a CEO, talking with his car while driving, and getting to know insights about his company our concurrency. For sure he will be more informed even before getting to office. 
Imagine a Marketing team meeting, where attendees are making use of a personal assistant for presenting results or even better, to predict the expected results for a certain campaign.
Imagine a consultant going to catch his flight and use the personal assistant to know the queues sizes at the airport and get insights about the best time to arrive to airport without the risk of spending too much time on airport or getting too late. 

Don't just imagine, I do believe it's not hard, you should also believe! We are already there!

#Hey Alexa, Ok Google or just Go Pentaho! It's up to you! Pentaho can be the engine used for the Analytics on your personal assistant

So, the video and example that you could see, is an example of a personal assistant built on top of Pentaho using DialogFlow and Pentaho. Pentaho is the engine for the analytics. Even so we can to pretty much similar to work integrated with your favourite personal assistant, Google Now, Alexa, Google Assistant or even use it as a bot for Facebook Messenger or Slack. 

I would say that everyone is already aware of the use of Personal Assistant and that they are part of our future. They are being used for personal request like or to make questions, but why not use them to get insights or request analysis to them? There no reason, we can even get the insights or results on a screen so what are you waiting for?

#How far can we go?

We can do much more with it. Per instance I have built an augmented reality app (I can't forget to write a new post about it), so we could also use the AR and Personal Assistant to refine our analysis. 

Interesting that I get much far away on this reach than I would expect and found many ways to integrate Pentaho engine. both for visualizations and data integration and AI, but that's a big conversation so I need to do it in multiple blog post. 

On the next blog post I will cover what are the ways to embed Pentaho.
