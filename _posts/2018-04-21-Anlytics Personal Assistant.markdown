It would be nice to have Pentaho as the engine for Analytics for Virtual Assistants as Google Now, Google Assistant, Alexa Facebook Messenger or even Slack among others.  So, as a proof-of-concept, I've build a virtual assistant using Pentaho and DialogFlow. 

## Hi, how can I help?

When using the personal assistant, you will say "Hi Google" or "Alexa" and the your will get a response back as "Hi, how can I help?". Definitely it would be very useful if we could run analytics through our favourite personal assistant.  

I have produced a short video with a short demo on how we can perform analytics even without touching the keyboard or mouse.

## How hard can it be to run analytics on Pentaho?

Imagine final users on their energy provider app using their smart homes with any Virtual Assistant to get to know how much energy they are consuming, or how much will they save on costs or how "green" they are becoming.

Imagine also a CEO, talking with his car while driving, and getting to know insights about his company status. For sure he will be more informed even before getting to office.  

Imagine a Marketing team meeting, where attendees are making use of a virtual assistant for presenting results or even better, to request for a prediction on the expected results for a certain marketing campaign.

Imagine a consultant going to catch his flight and use the virtual assistant on his/her smart phone to know the queues sizes at the airport and to get insights about the best time to arrive to airport without the risk of spending too much time on airport or getting too late. 

Don't just imagine, it's a reality and you can have it!

## Hey Alexa, Ok Google or just Go Pentaho! It's up to you! Pentaho can be the engine used for the Analytics on your personal assistant

The short video demo it's an example of a personal personal assistant built mainly using Pentaho and DialogFlow. Pentaho can this way, be used as the engine for almots all analytics you can thing of. The example has it's own webpage, but possible to make something similar, but, to work integrated with your favourite virtual assistant, Google Now, Alexa, Google Assistant or even use it as a bot for Facebook Messenger or Slack. 

I would say that everyone is already aware that the use of Virtual Personal Assistants is already part of our live. It's not the future. They are being used for personal request like or to make questions, but why not use them to get insights or request for analysis? 

## How far can we go?

Interesting that I got further away on the research and there are many interesting and rich uses cases to apply to. Imagination it's the limit!

On the next blog post I will start with the diferent ways to embed Pentaho and start getting into details, but for now lets close this post. 

**NOTE: that part of the solution was built with Pentaho Analyzer that's an Enterprise Feature. To have it full working you will need to have Enterprise Licenses**
