Embedding Analytics in Augmented Reality

I consider Augmented Reality to be the integration of digital information with the user's environment whose elements are augmented/supplemented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data.  Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, augmented reality uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it.

How about bringing **Analytics** to **Augmented Reality**? 

A good example would be applying it to smart cities or any other area, where it would be useful to place some analytics on top of our real world image being displayed on the screen of our smart car or simply to our smartphone or tablet. 

Would not only improve peoples life, allowing faster and more accurate decisions were to spend time and money, but also would improve the ability to increase business opportunities for companies.
There is  big pontential to generate business. Companies will see the advantage of giving the best information to the user, that can be driven by the behaviour of each user, like navigations, interests, searchs, and even controlled by the user trajectory after getting insights about places, objects, stores, products, services or anything else. I am sure it be will be big in future, and we will see Gartner paying some more attention to it sooner. 

I really like the idea of using advanced mobile apps, smart glasses or even a smart glass on your vehicle that can help on navigation and get insights that has as a starting point of input, sensors such as sound, video, graphics and GPS data. There are already some applications that allows you to simplify user’s life and that are improving the experience of the user, so why not also bringing analytics and improve it even more?

**[UPDATE from the 19th of July 2016]** Pockémon Go is the live proof that Augmented Reality will be a big part of our life in near future. So, anyone still have doubts about the potential of Augmented Reality and the business opportunities around it?

**I am glad to start the work to combine Analytics, Social Media and Augemented Reality, but need a sponsor.** Anyone to give a step front on this? 

**[UPDATE from the 19th of July 2016]** Maybe that one of these days I will have Insights on top of Pockémon Go. Just need Nintent to release an API that we can interact with! Do you wnat to know how many where catch on a specific area and if some of your friends did it? Well I was kidding about it, but who know!
